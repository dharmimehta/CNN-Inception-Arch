# CNN-Inception-Arch
We will look into the Inception CNN architecture.
Inception-V3 incorporates several additional ideas to further reduce the number
of parameters and computational cost.
An inception block applies 1x1, 3x3, 5x5 filters and max
pooling simultaneously. This aligns â€œwith the intuition that
visual information should be processed at various scales
and then aggregated so that the next stage can abstract
features from different scales simultaneously"
